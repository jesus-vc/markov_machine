SUMMARY:

- This is a terminal program where you can generate random text from a file or URL. The program leverages an algorithm resembling a Markov Machine, which emits output of a “Markov Chain.” The algorithm is written in the 'MarkovMachine' class in /src/markov.js.

- If a URL is provided, the program generates random text from the HTTP response.

- Data is validated to handle for various improper inputs, including an empty file, invalid URl inputs, and missing command arguments.

INSTRUCTIONS:

- The file you supply must already be stored in the /files directory. Currently, that only includes 'eggs.txt' and couple of other test files to test edge case errors.

- By default, the program will generate 100 words, unless you supply another number as the 5th argument. If the program selects a value of 'null' from a key's array of values, this marks the end of a 'Markov Machine' chain, which triggers the program to stop and output any randomly generated text.
